## Unsupervised overlap detection for single channel speech
This project is a python implementation of pyknogram extraction. 
Pyknograms are a modified verision of the STFT that emphasize more on
the harmonic structure of speech. 
This work is used for co-channel speech analysis. 
Feel free to reach out if you need help to run this code.

A detailed description of the algorithm is presented in our Transactions paper. Please cite:

- Prereqs:
    - `numpy`
    - `scipy`
    - `pylab`

The directory "code" contains an example script (example.py) that calculates pyknograms 
for the wavefile selection.wav

Run the following inside the code directory:

$python example.py selection ../selection.wav

Outputs will be:
    - figure1 : pyknogram
    - figure2 : mean(spectral flux of pyknograms)
    - figure3 : var(spectral flux)
